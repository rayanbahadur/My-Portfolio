        <h2>About <span class="red">Me</span></h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Rayan Bahadur and I am thrilled to be a first-year student at the Queen Mary University of London, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I have always been passionate about computers and programming, and I am eager to delve deeper into this field of study as I embark on this new journey.</p>
        <p>I was fortunate enough to have a strong academic background in secondary school and sixth form, having taken Computer Science and Mathematics and achieving three A grades. I was also actively involved in various extracurricular activities, such as building websites and UI/UX design, I have completed all three levels of the Duke of Edinburgh award, which helped me develop important skills such as unwavering resilience and self-motivation.</p>
        <p>Aside from academics, I have a variety of interests and hobbies that I enjoy in my free time, for example, I am an avid movie watcher, and I like reading books and listening to music. I believe that it is important to have a well-rounded approach to life and these activities provide a fun and creative outlet for me.</p>
        <p>I am excited to continue to learn and grow as a student at QMUL. I am eager to take on new challenges and opportunities, both inside and outside of the classroom, and I am looking forward to discovering my true potential as a student and individual.</p>
        <p>Overall, I am thrilled to start this new chapter in my life, and I am eager to see where my education and experiences will take me. I hope to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds!</p>
